                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>originally I had a problem with my buttons not showing up on the page, I asked wesbot a couple questions about it 
                    <br/> but I didn't get any helpful answers. I looked through the console and my code but couldn't solve the issue.
                    <br/> my partner and I worked together and both couldn't figure out how to make the buttons appear.
					<br/> Then for lab 14 I went back to fix and debug this lab and spent some time figuring it out. My problem was that
					<br/> my stylesheet wasn't linked correctly and I has some syntax errors.</p>
