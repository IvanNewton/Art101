					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a problem with my buttons not showing up on the page, I asked wesbot a couple questions about it 
						<br/> but i didn't get any helpful answers. I looked through the console and my code but couldn't solve the issue.
                        <br/> until I looked over my code with my partner and we helped each other out.</p>
