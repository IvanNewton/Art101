					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to have us experiment with data types and variables within Java Script.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I followed along with the canvas instructions well I just struggled with things like spelling errors messing up the code.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like I learned a lot from this lab. It was the first one I struggled with I think I will retain the information a bit more because of that. </p>
